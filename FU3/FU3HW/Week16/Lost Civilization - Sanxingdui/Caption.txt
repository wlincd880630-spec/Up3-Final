1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
Deep in the heart of Sichuan,
China lies a mystery that has

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
baffled (使困惑) archaeologists (考古学家) for decades (数十年),
a lost civilization whose secrets

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,670
have remained buried for over 3000
years.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,870
Join us as we unravel (揭示；解开) the enigma (谜；不解之谜) of
the Sanxingdui culture, an

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,270
ancient society unlike anything
we've seen in Chinese history.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,910
The story of Sanxingdui begins in
1929, when a farmer in Sichuan

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,350
province stumbled upon (偶然发现) a collection
of jade artifacts (文物；人工制品) while digging a

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,510
well.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,910
This discovery was the first hint
of something extraordinary (非凡的),

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,030
but it wasn't until the 1980s that
the magnitude (规模；重要性) of the Sanxingdui

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,990
site was truly revealed.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,450
Archaeologists uncovered 2 massive
sacrificial pits (祭祀坑) filled with jade,

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,070
bronze, gold and even ivory (象牙)
artifacts.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,470
Artifacts unlike anything
previously seen in China.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,670
These discoveries would go on to
challenge everything we thought we

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,310
knew about early Chinese
civilization.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,980
The most striking (引人注目的) finds at
Sanxingdui were the massive bronze

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,580
masks. These masks, some of which

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,460
stood over a meter tall, had
exaggerated (夸张的) features.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,940
Large almond shaped (杏仁形的) eyes, angular (有棱角的)
faces, and haunting (萦绕心头的；令人难忘的) expressions.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,820
They seem almost otherworldly (超凡的；似乎来自另一个世界的),
unlike any other depictions of

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,580
ancient Chinese deities (神灵) or figures.
Who created these masks and what

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,140
purpose did they serve?
Were they meant to depict gods,

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,480
ancestors (祖先), or perhaps even
beings beyond our world?

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,170
The Sanxingdui civilization is
thought to have flourished (繁荣；兴盛) around

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,530
1200 BCE during the Bronze Age.
But here's where things get

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,130
puzzling (令人困惑的).

This culture seemed to exist in

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,490
complete isolation (完全孤立) from other early
Chinese civilizations like the

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,410
Shang dynasty.
Despite being contemporaneous (同时代的) with

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,570
the Shang, the artifacts from
Sanxingdui were distinct (截然不同的).

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,130
Their style, craftsmanship (工艺),
and symbolism were unlike anything

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,810
found in Shang culture.
This has led many to speculate (推测) that

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,390
the Sanxingdui people had

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,150
their own unique worldview (世界观),
one that developed independently

35
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,670
from other ancient Chinese
societies.

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,230
Another fascinating aspect of the
Sanxingdui civilization is their

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,230
sudden disappearance (突然消失).
Around 1100 BCE, the site was

38
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,630
mysteriously abandoned (遗弃；放弃), and
the people seem to vanish without a

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,110
trace (消失得无影无踪).
There are no historical records

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,070
that explain why.
Some researchers suggest that a

41
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,630
natural disaster, such as an
earthquake or a flood, may

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,510
have forced the Sanxingdui
people to leave.

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,640
Others think they may have

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,400
migrated (迁移) and blended into (融入) other
emerging cultures, but the

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
truth remains elusive (难以捉摸的).

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,770
The artifacts found in the pits
also raise questions.

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,610
Many of the bronze masks, statues,
and jade items were deliberately (故意地)

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,690
broken before being buried.
It appears that these items were

49
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,370
sacrificed (献祭), but for what purpose?
Who were these offerings meant for?

50
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,970
The presence of elephant tusks at
the site, something quite rare

51
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,850
in ancient China, suggests
that the Sanxingdui people had

52
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,530
access to distant regions,
possibly engaging in (从事；参与) long-distance

53
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,070
trade (长距离贸易) or having cultural
connections.

54
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,910
That stretched across Asia.

55
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,030
Theories about the Sanxingdui
culture abound (大量存在).

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,270
Some believe that the alien-like
appearance of the mask suggests

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,230
extraterrestrial (外星的) influence.
Could the Sanxingdui people have

58
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,470
had contact with beings from
another world?

59
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,510
While there is no concrete evidence
to support such claims, the

60
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,590
idea has certainly captured the
imagination (激发想象力) of many.

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,550
More grounded theories propose that the

62
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,790
artifacts reflect the spiritual and
religious practices of the

63
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,310
Sanxingdui people.
The large bronze trees discovered

64
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,630
at the site, for instance,
may have symbolized

65
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,270
a connection between the earth and
the heavens, possibly indicating

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,990
a form of ancestor worship (祖先崇拜) or a
belief in cosmic balance (宇宙平衡).

67
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,030
The discovery of Sanxingdui has
reshaped (重塑) our understanding of early

68
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,950
Chinese history.
For a long time, it was believed

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,110
that the cradle of Chinese
civilization was centered around

70
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,910
the Yellow River, where the
Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties

71
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,630
emerged.
But Sanxingdui challenges that

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,430
narrative (叙述；说法), suggesting that
ancient China was far more diverse

73
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,030
than previously thought, a
patchwork (拼凑图) of independent cultures,

74
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,030
each contributing to the rich
heritage of the region.

75
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,710
In recent years, new excavations (发掘)
at Sanxingdui have continued to

76
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,790
reveal more secrets.
In 2021, archaeologists uncovered

77
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,110
6 additional sacrificial pits
filled with even more bronze

78
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,670
statues, gold masks, and jade
artifacts.

79
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,070
These new discoveries have
reignited (重新点燃) interest in the site and

80
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,150
brought us closer to understanding
the people who lived there.

...

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
that were both unique and
profoundly (深刻地) mysterious.



90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,480
The Sanxingdui site stands as a
testament (证明；见证) to the creativity and

91
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,360
ingenuity (独创性；聪明才智) of a civilization that
chose to express itself in ways

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
that were both unique and 
profoundly mysterious. 

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,950
Perhaps one day we will uncover 
the. 

94
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,590
Answers that have eluded us for so 
long. 

95
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,950
Until then, the golden masks, 
broken statues, and bronze 

96
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,550
trees will continue to whisper 
their secrets, inviting us 

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,870
to explore, to question, and 
to wonder about the lost 

98
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,230
civilization of sanctioning DUI. 
What secrets still lie buried 

99
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,990
beneath the sands of time? 

100

intrigued you, make sure to
